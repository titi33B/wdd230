                <p>Steve is 42 and has a wife and two dogs and no kids. When he's not working he enjoys spending time in the national parks near Grafton.</p>
                <p>Steve is concerned about the increasing prices of car parts and the difficulty in acquiring parts important to the success of his business. He's also worried about growing his business as demand increases with increased tourism and new growth in the town.</p>

                <h3>Charlotte</h3>
                <p>Charlotte is a 28-year-old living in Grafton who recently took over ownership and operation of an antique store in Grafton from her parents. Her mother recently became ill and needed to retire from running the store.</p>
                <p>Charlotte has a Bachelor's degree in marketing and social media. She was planning on moving to a bigger city to pursue her passion for helping companies build their brand on social media, but has decided to stay in Grafton for a few more years to run the antique shop.</p>
                <p>Charlotte doesn't know a lot about running a business but she's a quick learner. She's most concerned with turning a profit and keeping a good stock. Acquiring new antique items is both challenging and competitive, with so many private buyers taking up the market now.</p>
