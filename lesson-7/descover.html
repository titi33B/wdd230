        <b>Redlands city</b>
        
         <br>For more than 40 years, the Redlands Theatre Festival has earned a reputation for excellence in performance, entertainment and location. The season begins the second week of July and continues through the third week of August. 
         Productions in this open-air environment typically include a major Broadway musical, an Off-Broadway musical, a contemporary drama, a recent Broadway release and a period piece.
         
        <br><br>On April 14, 2022, the Parks and Recreation Commission formed a subcommittee to discuss the re-opening of Market Night and at their May meeting, the subcommittee recommended that Market Night be reintroduced with some modifications. 
        These modifications addressed limited staffing levels as well as a transition back to full operations.

        <b>Redlands city</b><br>
          Redlands is a city in southern California, near San Bernardino. 
          It's known for its elaborate late-1800s buildings, such as the A.K. Smiley Public Library and the Morey Mansion.
          Kimberly Crest House & Gardens is a sprawling estate, with a Victorian mansion and Renaissance-styled gardens.
          Concerts are held at the Redlands Bowl, a 1920s amphitheater.
          San Bernardino County Museum offers hands-on natural history exhibits.
            
         <br><br> For more than 125 years, Redlands has been known as a community that celebrates its past and embraces its future. Early on, agriculture prospered with the navel orange, and many citrus groves can still be found in Redlands today.
         Over the years, the City has earned a well-deserved reputation as a cultural and educational leader. Incorporated in 1888, community leaders have continually set high standards for housing, business, education and recreation.
          Since its founding in 1881, Redlands remains a city positioned for continued economic success!  
         
        
         <br><br> Redlands residents and visitors have a variety of cultural and recreational amenities to choose from including a vibrant historic downtown; challenging 18-hole golf course; four performing arts theaters/amphitheaters;
              six museums; nature preserve; 18 city parks; a 36-acre sports complex; nearly 30 miles of hiking and equestrian trails; and over 36 miles of Class I, II and III bicycle paths.
